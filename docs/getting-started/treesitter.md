# Syntax tree queries using Tree-sitter

Knut uses Tree-sitter to build a syntax tree of your files and query data from it.

From the [Tree-sitter website][treesitter]:
> Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library.
> It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited.

> Tree-sitter aims to be:
>
> - **General** enough to parse any programming language
> - **Fast** enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
> - **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
> - **Dependency-free** so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can be embedded in any application

## Tree-sitter in Knut
Version 1.1 of Knut introduced support for Tree-sitter.

Currently support in user scripts is limited to:

- Inspecting the concrete syntax tree generated by Tree-sitter using the "Tree-sitter Inspector".
- Running [Tree-sitter Queries][queries]
- Only available on C/C++ files

However, this already allows for some very easy & powerful analysis and modification of C++ source files.

Knut also returns Tree-sitter query results in some of its high-level methods.
Usually in the form of the [QueryMatch][querymatch] class.

See the [QueryMatch documentation][querymatch] for more details of how to use this class.

Compared to the language server, Tree-sitter is a lot more resistant to errors and works well, even if the current code would not compile.
For this reason many Knut functions internally rely on Tree-sitter instead of the language server.
This may result in false-positives though, as Tree-sitter only works on a syntax level and doesn't understand the high-level structures of the code.
Tree-sitter will especially struggle if symbols are overloaded, as all references may be picked up.

## Writing Tree-sitter queries

Tree-sitter queries are a powerful tool, as the syntax tree parsed by Tree-sitter makes it easy to find functions, class definitions, etc.
For the exhaustive specification of the query syntax, see the [Tree-sitter website][queries].

Knut supports prototyping queries with the `Tree-sitter Inspector`, which can be accessed in the Knut GUI under the `C++` menu.

The Tree-sitter Inspector allows you to inspect the syntax tree of the current file.
Note that this does not include anonymous nodes (e.g. any symbols like -> * + - / ).
These are still in the syntax tree and can be queried.
For details, see the [query documentation][queries].

As the syntax tree can become large very quickly, the Inspector provides a bi-directional mapping to the edited file.

1. Clicking any node in the inspector will select the corresponding text in the document
2. Any node that includes the cursor position is highlighted in green.

Additionally, you can test your queries in the bottom-left input field.
The Tree-sitter Inspector will notify you of errors in your query and display the number of patterns, matches and captures as you type.
Any captured nodes will also display their captures in the syntax tree view.

After prototyping a query, it can easily be included in a script by calling [`query`][lspdocument-query] on any LSP capable document (e.g. C/C++).
Together with Javascripts [Destructuring Assignment][destructuring] and [Template Literals][template-literals] this makes queries very ergonomic to use in your own scripts.

Example:
``` javascript
let className = /*...*/;

//  Destructuring Assignment with [ ] can be used if only one result is expected.
let [constructor] = cppFile.query(`
    (function_definition
        declarator: (function_declarator
            declarator: (qualified_identifier
                scope: (_) @scope
                (identifier) @name)
                (#eq? "${className}" @scope @name))
        body: (compound_statement) @body)
`);
//                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Note how className was entered directly into the query using the ${...} syntax.

// The result will be an empty list if nothing was found.
// When using destructuring assignment, constructor will then be undefined.
if (!constructor) {
    Message.warn(`Cannot find constructor for class ${className}`);
    return;
}

// Get the text of a capture
let old_body = constructor.get("body").text;

// Modify a capture
constructor.get("body").replace("body").replace(`{
    std::log << "${className} Constructor" << std::endl;
}`);

// Or remove it outright
constructor.get("body").remove()
```

## Predicates

Tree-sitter queries can be extended by the embedding application (in this case Knut) using predicates.

Knut currently provides implementations for these predicates:

### `(#eq? [args]+)`
Check if all arguments are exactly string-equal

Example usage to find the constructor of `MyClass`
``` treesitter
(function_definition
    declarator: (function_declarator
        declarator: (qualified_identifier
            scope: (_) @scope
            (identifier) @name)
            (#eq? "MyClass" @scope @name))
    body: (compound_statement) @body)
```
Would find the constructor of the class `MyClass`.

### `(#match? [regex] [args]+)`
Check if the given `args` match the given `regex`

Example usage to find all member function definitions of `MyClass`
``` treesitter
(function_definition
    declarator: (function_declarator
        declarator: (_) @name
            (#match? "MyClass::" @name))
    body: (compound_statement) @body)
```

### `(#in_message_map? [capture]+)`
Check if the given capture is within a MFC message map.

Example usage to find all elements of the message map:
``` treesitter
(
(expression_statement) @expr
(#in_message_map? @expr)
)
```
Note that for most operations, using [`CppDocument::mfcExtractMessageMap`][extract-message-map] is probably easier.
